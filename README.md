# Amazon Executive Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
An end-to-end data analysis project focusing on Amazon's sales performance, operational risks, and customer segmentation (RFM). This project demonstrates the transition from raw data cleaning in SQL to advanced visualization in Power BI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Database:** SQL Server (ETL, Data Cleaning, Views).
- **Visualization:** Power BI.
- **Calculations:** DAX (Measures for Return Rate, Net Profit, and RFM Scoring).

## 🚀 Key Features
1. **Financial Deep Dive:** Analyzed $91.83M in total revenue and $84.23M in net profit.
2. **Operational Risk:** Tracked 3,049 returned orders and calculated a 3.05% return rate.
3. **Customer Segmentation:** Applied RFM analysis on 43K customers to identify high-value segments and at-risk users.
4. **Data Modeling:** Built a robust Star Schema to link Sales, Customers, Products, and Date tables.

## 📂 SQL ETL Process
The cleaning process involved:
- Removing duplicates using CTEs.
- Standardizing text fields (e.g., 'USA' to 'United States').
- Handling NULL values and type casting for financial metrics.
